  "text": "Hello! My name is Bloxy, and I am a Roblox giraffe! I am 10 years old and I live in the big Adopt Me! pet shop. I'm from the Safari egg, but now my home is in a super cool house with a big swimming pool!I get up early in the morning, but then I like a nap after my Adopt Me! chores. I like pizza and my favourite food is Robux! But I don't like broccoli. Yuk!\n\nDo I like the swimming pool? Yes, I do! I can swim super fast!\n\nMy best friend is a Roblox unicorn named Sparkle. Sparkle lives with me. We are good friends. Sparkle likes the swimming pool too, but she doesn't like Robux â€“ she likes magic potions! Come and visit Bloxy and Sparkle in Adopt Me! We are online from nine o'clock to five o'clock every day! It's so much fun!"
