  "text": "It was a beautiful autumn day in the forest. The sun was warm, but the wind was cool. A little red Squirrel was running up a big oak tree. She was looking for food. She found a big, brown acorn. \"This is perfect for winter!\" she said happily.\nSuddenly, a yellow leaf landed on her nose. Squirrel shook her head and continued her work. She also found a tasty nut under a hazel tree.\nHer friend, the Hedgehog, was walking slowly through the forest. He was looking under the bushes. He found a bush with many red berries. \"These berries are so sweet!\" he said. He ate one berry and put the others in a little pile.\nSquirrel saw Hedgehog. \"Hello, Hedgehog!\" she called. \"I am collecting food for the cold days.\"\n\"I am too,\" said Hedgehog. \"But I am small and slow. Winter is coming very fast.\"\nThey decided to ask their wise friend, the Badger, for help. Badger was very clever and always prepared. They went to his home. Badger lived in a deep, comfortable burrow under an old tree.\n\"Hello, friends!\" said Badger. \"Come into my burrow. It is safe and warm here.\" They told Badger about their problem.\n\"Don't worry,\" said Badger. \"We can work together. My burrow is very big. We can store all our food here. We can share it in winter!\"\nSquirrel, Hedgehog, and Badger worked all day. Squirrel collected nuts and acorns. Hedgehog found berries and apples. Badger organized everything in his burrow.\nWhen the sun set, they were very tired but very happy. Now they had a lot of food. They were ready for winter. They were not afraid because they had each other. Friendship is the best gift of autumn."
