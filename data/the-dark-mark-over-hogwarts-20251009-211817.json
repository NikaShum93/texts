  "text": "The Dark Mark appeared in the sky over Hogwarts! It was a sign of great danger. The ghosts of grammar mistakes were flying around the castle, making everyone confused and scared. Harry Potter needed help, and you were the only one who could do it.\n\nFirst, you had to think hard. You remembered that on Halloween night a lot of mystical creatures  could come so close to the castle.\n\nNext, you found the Time-Turner. You turned it and saw the past. You saw Hogwarts on the last Halloween at 8 o'clock in the evening. Professor Dumbledore was giving a speech. The students were eating a big feast, and Nearly Headless Nick was dancing. It was a happy memory that gave you hope.\n\nThen, you ran to the Forbidden Forest to find Hagrid. He was looking for magical beasts to protect the school. You helped him.  These kind creatures agreed to help guard Hogwarts.\n\nFinally, you returned to the castle. The Great Hall was ready for the feast. But there was one last thing to do. You saw the flying candlesticks from the walls. You had to catch them all to create a powerful shield. You caught the last one and shouted, \"Protect Hogwarts!\""
