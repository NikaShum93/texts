  "title": "What are your parents doing now?",
  "text": "Maybe they're watching you, listening to you or finding out where you are. How? It's all thanks to new high-tech equipment from specialist companies in the USA.\nA company called Blade Runner has a jacket with GPT system inside. It costs $500, and for $20 a month your parents can always see where you are (or where your jacket is!) But that's nothing. Do your parents want to know want you're eating?  No problem. My NutriKids  tells them what you're having for lunch at school. Do your parents want to know your exam results? GradeSpeed is a service which gives them that information. Do they want to know what online conversations you're having? IMSafer tells them. You usually arrive on time for extra-curricular sports classes. But if one day you don't arrive on time, there's a service which informs your parents.  And there's another service which sends them a message if you go outside a specific area.\nSo, are your parents protecting you or are they spying on you? Babies and small children need constant care and protecting. But is it really important for parents to know where their teenage kids are every minute of the Adolescents need to take their own decisions and make their own mistakes. Mistakes are an important part of growing up, of passing from childhood to independence. We think it's important for parents to give their children the opportunity to do this."
