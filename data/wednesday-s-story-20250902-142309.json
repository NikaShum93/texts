  "text": "My name is Wednesday Addams. I live in a big, dark house. My family is very different.\n\nRight now, I am writing in my diary. My brother, Pugsley, is playing with a new explosive. He is making a lot of noise. I do not like noise.\n\nYesterday was a good day. In the morning, I walked to the forest behind our house. It was raining, and the sky was grey. I loved it.\n\nWhile I was sitting under a dead tree, I saw a black cat. It was watching a spider. The cat was very quiet and serious. I liked that cat.\n\nSuddenly, a girl from my school, Emily, appeared. She was wearing a bright pink dress. It was horrible.\nHello, Wednesday! she said. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I am planning my future,\" I answered. It was true.\n\nEmily laughed. \"I am going to have a birthday party on Saturday,\" she said. \"You can come!\"\n\nI thought about it. A party with loud music and happy children. It sounded like a nightmare.\n\"Thank you,\" I said. \"I am going to be very busy on Saturday. I am going to watch spiders with my new cat.\"\n\nEmily's smile disappeared. She left quickly. I was smiling inside. It was a perfect conversation.\n\nNow, I am in my room. Tonight, my family is going to watch a movie about vampires. I am going to sit in my favorite chair. I am going to drink dark grape juice. It is going to be a perfect evening."
