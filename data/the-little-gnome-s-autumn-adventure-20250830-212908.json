  "text": "A little gnome named Pip lived under a big oak tree. One windy morning, his favorite red hat flew away. Pip ran after his hat into the colorful forest. The hat flew over a sleepy hedgehog. \"Good morning!\" said Pip and quickly ran past. Then, the hat landed on a pile of yellow leaves, but the wind blew it up into the air again. A friendly squirrel saw Pip and wanted to help. The squirrel jumped from tree to tree and pointed to a small stream. The hat was on a rock in the water. Pip was too small to get it. Then, a kind frog saw the problem. The frog jumped onto the rock and pushed the hat back to the shore with his foot. \"Thank you!\" said the happy gnome. Pip put on his warm, dry hat. He walked home with his new friends. They drank warm tea under the oak tree. It was a perfect autumn adventure."
