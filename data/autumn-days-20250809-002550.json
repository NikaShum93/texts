  "text": "The days grow colder and the nights grow longer.\nLeaves change their colour — from green to gold, orange, and red.\nThe wind blows softly through the trees, making the branches sway.\nChildren play outside, kicking leaves high into the air.\nSometimes a cloud hides the pale sun, and rain begins to fall.\nIn the evening, families stay inside, drinking hot cocoa and telling stories by the fire.\nAutumn is a time of change — a bright and cosy season before the snow.",
