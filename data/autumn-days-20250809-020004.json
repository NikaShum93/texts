  "text": "The days grow colder and the nights grow longer. Leaves change their colour — from green to gold, orange, and red. The wind blows softly through the trees, making the branches sway. Children play outside, kicking leaves high into the air. Sometimes a cloud hides the pale sun, and rain begins to fall. In the evening, families stay inside, drinking hot cocoa and telling stories by the fire. Autumn is a time of change — a bright and cosy season before the snow.",
