On the last night of October, Fred tried to write his story by the fire.
He could hear the whistling wind outside.
A gnome stood near the knitted scarf on the chair.
Fred wanted to climb the old tree, but the light rain began.
His lamb was sleeping by the door.
The next day, he would pick apples and drink warm tea.
