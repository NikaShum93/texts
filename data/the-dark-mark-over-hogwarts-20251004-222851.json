  "text": "The Dark Mark is in the sky over Hogwarts! Everyone is scared. The ghosts of grammar mistakes are in the castle. You must save the school.\n\nFirst, you need to think. Who can come to Hogwarts on Halloween night.\nNext, you find the Time-Turner. You use it to see the past. You look at Hogwarts last Halloween at 8 o'clock in the evening. You see Professor Dumbledore. He is giving a speech. The students are eating a big feast. The ghosts are dancing at the party. It is a happy memory.\n\nThen, you run to the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid is there. He is sad. He needs to find the magical beasts. The beasts can protect Hogwarts from the grammar ghosts. Finally, you go to the Room of Requirement. You find secret places there. You open them and see  words. You understandâ€”these words make a powerful spell. You say the spell out loud. A bright light fills the room. The Dark Mark disappears! Hogwarts is safe again. You are a hero!\n\n"
